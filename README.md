# Climate Model Bias Correction Tools
This repository contains tools for bias correction methods applied to climate model outputs. 

## Overview
Climate models play a crucial role in understanding and predicting environmental changes. However, biases in these models can impact the accuracy of predictions. The tools in this repository aim to address these biases through various correction methods.

### Excel Files
The repository includes two Excel files:
1.Quantile Empirical Mapping.xlsx
2.Bias Correction Methods__ DM_DMV_QGM.xlsm

If you use these tools or refer to the bias correction methods in your research, please cite the following papers:
